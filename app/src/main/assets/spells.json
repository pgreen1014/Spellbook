You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city form across the Sea of Fire at the DM's discression.\n\nAlternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closes unoccupied spaces next to the circle.\n\nYou can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscrived on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can furter refine the rigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filing a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 inutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\nDEATH. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nDISCORD. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with othe rcreatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\nFEAR. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 20 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\nHOPELESSNESS. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw, On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n\nINSANITY. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw, On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n\nPAIN. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\nSLEEP. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n\nSTUNNING.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be case, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\n\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\n\nTARGETED EFFECTS. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\n\nAREAS OF MAGIC. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creatuing a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\nSPELLS. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is init.\n\nMAGIC ITEMS. The properties and powers ofmagic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a mnonmagical longsword.\n\nA magic weapon's properites and powers are supprssed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n\nMAGICAL TRAVEL. Teleportation an planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whetere the sphere is the destination or thd eparture point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n\nCREATURES AND OBJECTS. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer wihtin the sphere.\n\nDISPEL MAGIC. Spells an magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.",

Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 X 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side.

The tremor deal 50 bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requireing a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.
